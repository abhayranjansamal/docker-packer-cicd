# PACKER - IMAGE BUILDER

## (Packer AMI + Ansible Provisioned Docker Container + Python Flask + CI/CD Jenkins)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Here I have created an Amazon Machine Golden Image with a packer as Infrastructure as Code. The Image has been provisioned with a docker container and in that docker container, a python flask application is configured. In the part of CI/CD - Jenkins provides a pipeline with the upstream job. So the first project triggers another project as part of its execution. 

The first phase of the project is that the developers will be updating the necessary changes in the flask application, once they have completed the changes. They will upload the code to the Github Central Repository. In the part of Jenkins, a pipeline job is set up. The initial job is to build an image with the details updated by the developers and for triggering the job a webhook is configured. In that process, an image is created and it will be updated to the docker hub. These mentioned processes will be implemented via an ansible playbook. 

The second phase for the project is packer AMI building. As mentioned above a pipeline job is configured in the Jenkins. Once the initial job executes successfully and stable state. It will move on with the second job and in that packer will be triggered via the packer plugin in Jenkins. An image will be created and for the same, the ansible-playbook provisioning  a docker container with the image that has been uploaded to the docker hub which contains the python flask application.


**Packer** is a tool for building identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. It is also lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel.

**Flask** is an API of Python that allows to build up web applications. Flask’s framework is more explicit than Django’s framework. A Web-Application Framework is the collection of modules and libraries that helps the developer to write applications without writing the low-level codes such as protocols, thread management. 


## Features

- Fast Infrastructure Deployment - Allows to launch, completely provision, and configured machines in seconds
- Multi-provider portability 
- Automated scripts to install and configure the software within the Packer-made images.
- Packer installs and configures all the software for a machine at the time the image is built.
- Flask is easier to learn as it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application
- Continuous Deployment with Jenkins, makes whole jobs simpler

## Packer Code

> Here update the below-given variables with the required values as per the requirements. Consider given below as an example.

```sh
variable "region" {

}

variable "instance_type" {
    default = "t2.micro"
}

locals {
  timestamp = regex_replace(timestamp(), "[- TZ:]", "")
}

## User Instructions

- Clone the Git repository
```sh
git clone git@github.com:abhayranjansamal/docker-packer-cicd.git
```
### Jenkins Configuration

- Install the Packer Plugin and configure accordingly
- In the Same way, Install the Ansible plugin and configure it
- Update the webhook URL of GitHub for triggering the Jenkins
> Similar configuration of the Jenkins and the plugins can be referred to another project:- https://github.com/ajish-antony/asg-rolling-update

> Other Main Points to note that to update the packer plugin with the file that needs to perform the action

> Next in the Post-build Action in the first project to trigger the packer. Consider the below given as an example.
